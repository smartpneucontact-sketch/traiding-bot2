"""Per-slot model configuration — what runs, where its keys live, what
risk overlays are enabled.

A "slot" is one Alpaca account paired with one model file. The dashboard
edits a JSON config (`model_config.json` on the Railway volume) with up
to N slots; this module reads that config and falls back to env vars if
no slot in the config file resolves to a usable model + key pair.

`ModelConfig` is the per-slot runtime dataclass. It carries the model
file path, Alpaca creds, and the cutloss thresholds — everything the
runner needs to operate one slot.

`MODEL_REGISTRY` lists every model name we *can* run (v4..v8) and where
to find its pickled artifact. `MODEL_DESCRIPTIONS` is the human-facing
metadata that the dashboard renders.
