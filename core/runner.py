"""Daily pipeline orchestrator.

`run_pipeline()` is the top-level entry point hit by the daily cron. It:

  1. Discovers active model slots (from config file or env vars)
  2. Downloads bars + macro **once**, shared across all slots
  3. Computes macro features once
  4. Hands off to `run_single_model()` per slot, which:
     - loads the slot's pickled model
     - generates predictions
     - filters inactive Alpaca assets
     - applies V6/V8 regime + conviction-weighted sizing
     - rebalances via `core.orders.rebalance_portfolio`
     - updates persisted state + history

`load_model_bundle()` handles the custom unpickler that maps any
training-script module path (`__main__`, `scripts.train_ml_v6`, …) to
the in-tree `StackedEnsemble` / `EnsembleModel` classes so model
artifacts deserialize cleanly regardless of how they were trained.
